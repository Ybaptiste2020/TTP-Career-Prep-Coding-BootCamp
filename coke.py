'''
    implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. 
    Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. 
    Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.

coin = input("User Please insert a coin \n")  #Prompts the user for a coin.

while coin != "0":  #While the coin is not 0, the loop will continue.
    if coin == "5" or coin == "10" or coin == "25":  #If the coin is 5, 10, or 25, the loop will continue.
        amount_due - coin
        print("Amount Due: " + amount_due)  #Prints the amount due.
